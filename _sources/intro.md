# OndÅ™ej ZÃ­ka

Hi! 

I am a research scientist at the Karolinska Institute ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª and an ERC fellow at Bielefeld University ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. My research interests evolve around understanding how uncertainty impacts human decisions and how it relates to aspects of mental health (anxiety, eating disorders) and development. I am also interested in ways in which we can combine AI with longitudinal and multimodal approaches to improve prevention and diagnosis of mental health conditions. To study these topics I use range of experimental and computational methods (reinforcement learning, Bayesian models) together with physiology (eye-tracking, skin conductance) and neuroimaging (M/EEG, fMRI). 

I strive to make science inclusive and supportive for everyone. I very much welcome anyone reaching out with any questions or comments. I can be found [here](mailto:zika@mpib-berlin.mpg.de). 

P.S.: [**Å™**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9LQDTiDcrA) is a great sound, I know. And no, I don't expect anyone to try to pronounce it ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿:)

**July 2024: Talk at BAP 2024!**

I recently gave a short interview to [Mental  Elf](https://www.nationalelfservice.net/mental-health/) about my talk at the British Association for Psychopharmacology Annual Meeting (BAP). We briefly discuss how uncertainty generates moments of ambiguity about the causal structure of the world and how perhaps anxious individuals tend to fill in information to reduce the uneasing sense of uncertainty. We also discuss how this can sometimes result in wrong interpretation of for example social cues in anxiety. This is largely based on our recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39825-3).
