    "In this project we investigate how people varying in trait anxiety learn and how they represent aversive environments. We use a task characterised by alternating periods of relative safety and threat. To make predictions about probability of receiving shock on the next trial, one can either keep track of current shock probability in a trial-by-trial manner (using reinforcement learning-like mechanism), or, alternatively, one can learn that there are regular changes in shock probabilities and leverage this information to make more accurate predictions. Using computational models to characterise the two processes, we found that people higher in trait anxiety have a tendency to extract such latent structures. While this means that high trait anxious participants are better at following the experimental contingencies, it might also mean that they are more likely to experience return-of-fear phenomena such as spontaneous recovery or reinstatement.

In this project we try to relate the objective threat with subjective experinces, and how these are influenced by individual differences. \n",
