# # Berlin Carsharing App
# 
# Over the past few years, Berlin has experienced boom in carsharing. One way that they main companies compete is by distinct pricing strategies - some charge by km, some by minute, some charge by minute, but have special deals in which they charge by km, etc. To help one make the best decision for a given trip I made this simple site where you simply need to input expected km, duration and parking time (+ a few more bits in the extended version) and it lists the price for each company, as well as the best deal available.
