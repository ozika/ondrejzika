# [**groo**](https://pypi.org/project/groo-ozika/) - *find your Python root*   
# A tool for identify the root of the current project. Inspired by R's `here` package. Termed *the most useful thirteen lines of code for reproducible research in Python* by no one.

# [**bammm**](https://pypi.org/project/bammm-ozika/) - bambi/pymc model management  
# A  tool to help one keep track of estimated Bayesian models in python (pymc) in a handy JSON structure. If `bammm` detects that a given model has already been estimated it loads the results. This makes Bayesian linear mixed effects models in python almost as usable as `lmer` in `R`.
