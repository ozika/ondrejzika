# In this project we investigate how people varying in trait anxiety learn and how they represent aversive environments. We use a task characterised by alternating periods of relative safety and threat. To make predictions about probability of receiving shock on the next trial, one can either keep track of current shock probability in a trial-by-trial manner (using reinforcement learning-like mechanism), or, alternatively, one can learn that there are regular changes in shock probabilities and leverage this information to make more accurate predictions. Using computational models to characterise the two processes, we found that people higher in trait anxiety have a tendency to extract such latent structures. While this means that high trait anxious participants are better at following the experimental contingencies, it might also mean that they are more likely to experience return-of-fear phenomena such as spontaneous recovery or reinstatement.

# In this project we ask the question how does the orbitofrontal cortext integrate contextual information into decisions when both current context and sensory input are uncertain. To achieve this goal we use partially observable Markov decision process model together with functional multivariate MRI.

# {bdg-secondary}`learning and choice`  
# The commonly prescribed blood pressure medication losartan (angiotensin-II receptor blocker) has recently been linked to reduction in fear learning, including lower chance of developing PTSD in war veterans. Here, we use double-blind design and probabilistic aversive learning task over three sessions to investigate the role of losartan in aversive learning.

# How do trait anxiety and depression impact attitudes, behaviours and worries about changing real-world threat? Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed large pool of participants across 20 sessions enquiring about their worries, behaviours and attitudes. At the same time, we collected number of objective indicators such as number of cases and deaths in the area. In this project we try to relate the objective threat with subjective experinces, and how these are influenced by individual differences.
