Hi! 

I am a postdoctoral scientist working at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. My research interests evolve around understanding how uncertainty impacts human decisions and how it interacts with different aspects of mental health (anxiety, eating disorders) and development. To study these topics I use range of experimental and computational methods (reinforcement learning, Bayesian models) together with physiology (eye-tracking, skin conductance) and neuroimaging (fMRI). 

Apart from academic research, I sometimes get involved in data science and coding projects. For example, I recently made an app to compare the price of different carsharing services in Berlin ([here](https://ozika-berlin-travel-cost-scriptsberlin-transport-app-rfbxe9.streamlit.app/)). Lastly, motivatated by having a real-world reach, I also sometimes help as a data science consultant. 

I strive to make science inclusive and supportive for everyone. I very much welcome anyone reaching out with any questions or comments about science, career or life in general. I can be found [here](mailto:zika@mpib-berlin.mpg.de). 


P.S.: [**ř**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9LQDTiDcrA) is a great sound, I know. No, I don't expect anyone to try to pronounce it :)
